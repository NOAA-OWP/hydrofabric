```{r setup, include=FALSE}

# NextGen

Once we have a network aggregated to a scale matching the desired hydrologic processes we need to turn it into something NextGen can use (modeling task)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('../man/figures/roadmap2.png')
```

## Divergent Topology 

NextGen operates on a `[flowpath --> nexus]` vs `[flowpath --> flowpath]` topology

This is due to the HY Features conceptual catchment that has 1 inflow draining to 1 outflow.

And example of this can be seen below:

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="49%", fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c('../man/figures/topology.png', '../man/figures/topology2.png'))
```

## Character based indentification

NextGen requires integer based identification, like described in the data model, prefixed with a character string defining what the feature is

Right now, the following prefixs are used to distinguish between types of model features.

| Parameter        | Purpose           | Elected Value  | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| 
| nexus_prefix      | the maximum length flowpath desired in the output. | "nex-" |
| terminal_nexus_prefix      | the minimum length of inter-confluence flowpath desired in the output. | "tnx-" |
| coastal_nexus_prefix      | the minimum length of between-confluence flowpaths. | "cnx-" |
| internal_nexus_prefix      | the maximum length flowpath desired in the output. | "inx-" |
| catchment_prefix      | the minimum length of inter-confluence flowpath desired in the output. | "cat-" |
| waterbody_prefix      | the minimum length of between-confluence flowpaths. | "wb-" |


The following function (1) identifies nexus locations, (2) moves them when needed and (3) applies the above schema to the features.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
ngen = 'tutorial/nextgen.gpkg'

unlink(ngen)

ngen <- apply_nexus_topology("tutorial/aggregated.gpkg", export_gpkg = 'tutorial/nextgen.gpkg')
```

We can see the results of this by opening the hydrofabric and adding it to a map!

```{r}
mapview::mapview(read_hydrofabric(ngen)) + read_sf(ngen, "nexus")
```

## Extending NWM attributes

The core utilities provide a series of flowpath, divide, and nexuses.

```{r}
sf::st_layers(ngen)
```
However, other information is needed to run some/all NextGen formulations. These include the following:

### Lake Attributes

- WBOut Hydrolocations are mapped to the NHDPlusWaterBody COMIDs used in the NWM.

## Flowpath Attributes

- Flowpath attributes are extracted from the a Routelink file
- The values are length averaged by the portion of length each makes up in the refactored/aggregated network 

For example, if a 75m flowline has a roughness of 0.05 and a 25m flowline with a roughness of 0.2

```{r}
(n = (.75 * .05) + (.25 * .2))
```

Flowpaths attributes and lake parameters can be added by pointing to a set of NWM domain files like those found [here](https://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/codes/nwprod/nwm.v2.2.3/parm/domain/)

```{r, eval = TRUE}
add_flowpath_attributes(ngen, source = "/Users/mjohnson/hydrofabric")
```

```{r}
read_sf(ngen, "flowpath_attributes")
```

### Themeing

As an option, QGIS QML theming files can be added to a gpkg. Some default themeing files come with hydrofabric and can be specified/added with the `append_styles` utility on the desired `layer_names`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
append_style(ngen,layer_names = c("nexus", "hydrolocations", "flowpaths", "divides", "lakes"))
```

In [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html), double clicking the gpkg file will allow you to select which layers to load.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/hydrofabric.png")
```
