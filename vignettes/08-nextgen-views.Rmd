The [NextGen Hydrofabric Data Model](https://noaa-owp.github.io/hydrofabric/articles/04-data-model-deep-dive.html) aims to support a multi-realization
view of the river network and landscape using the concepts outlined in the [OGC HY Features Standard](https://docs.ogc.org/is/14-111r6/14-111r6.html).

The data model we are proposing, and enforcing, is aimed to allow flexible realizations with minimal data I/O. It does this by

  1. Defining a **principle realization**,
  2. Storing multiple layers of data in a self contained data format.
  3. Using opaque identifiers to reference realizations of the same hydrologic unit across layers
  
> **_NOTE:_**  All layers in the GPKG are realizations of the hydrologic landscape. Ulitmemtly there is one **principle realization** that defines the principle unit (e.g. flowpath) of the hydrologic landscaep. Moreover, one is a **viewed realization** - that is - the one that is being operated on. These do not have to be the same.

## NextGen

The notion of a HY Feature ready hydrofabric requires the ability to access a number of realizations. This is distinct from the
[reference fabric](02-design-deep-dive.html) which is intended to support the creation of data products that serve a range of modeling applications.
In its current state, NextGen requires a few realizations for model execution. This currently includes, but is likely not limited to, the following:

| | Task | Realization | Attributes | Example |
| - | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- |
| 1 | Forcing Engine | Divide complex **with** geometry | `divide_id`, `geometry` | Rescale gridded data to units of divide complex | 
| 2 | Rainfall Runoff Modeling | Divide complex **without** geometry | `divide_id`, `id` | Linking divide units to draining flowpath | 
| 3 | Routing | Flowpath network  | `id`, `toid` | Moving water from channel to channel | 
| 14 | Reporting | Location on River network coincident with features like a gage | `toid` | What is the flow at USGS gage XXX |

Here, we will show that the hydrofabric data model supports ALL of these tasks through clear examples that include the derivation process. Further, we will show how the `divides` view is comprehensive enough to support each of these tasks.

## Background

1. NextGen uses a `flowpath` --> `nexus` topology. This is a requirement of aggregating the divide complex to the desired
   spatial scale while avoiding a `many:1` `flowline` to `divide` relation.
   
 >  **_NOTE:_** In possible upcoming work with GID and FIM, we may relax that constraint by building out a `flowline` layer that would allow a `many:1` relationship _and_ a higher resolution flowline network. Such a step might also allow for a `fp` --> `fp` topology that is more consistent with the core of [t-route](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/t-route). Until that time, water flows from a flowpath to a nexus, and more then one flowpath may contribute to any one nexus.

2. The need to store many representations of the hydrologic landscape, both spatially and aspatially is a database challenge. In the spatial community,
   a well established way to store both spatial and aspatial data layers (or _tables_) in a single database is
   the [OGC GeoPackage Format]((https://www.geopackage.org/)). This format provides a standard for spatial information
   on top of SQLite databases.

3. While the hydrofabric identifiers are prefixed to make them human-readable, they should
   **not** be parsed within code to infer something more. The exception to this, is that it may be used to quickly identify the **principle realization**.

4. These are the R based libraries that will be used in this example. All of them have Python or other language equivalents.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(sf)      # spatial data access and manipulation
library(mapview) # interactive map creation
library(arrow)   # parquet read/write
library(dplyr)   # SQL syntax on data.frames

#> Some (R -> Python) equivalents for these packages are:
#> - sf      -> geopandas/shapely/fiona
#> - mapview -> folium
#> - arrow   -> pyarrow
#> - dplyr   -> pandas/polars
```

## NextGen Principle Realization

Due to the routing requirements of NextGen (Task #3), the connectivity of the flowpath network is the _principle realization_ of the
landscape and thus the primary realization of our hydrologic units. It is because of this, that the flowpath identification is given the`id` identifier. Anywhere that `id` is found in the HF GeoPackage, it is in reference to our **principle realization** - that of the flowpaths.

The flexibility of the HY Features standard, and our implemented data model make it possible to consider the hydrofabric from different perspectives, any one of these is the **viewed realization** when being operated on. A viewed realization is in essence, a distinct manifestion, or abstraction, over the underlying principle realization.

Selecting a viewed realization must consider the fundamental operations needed - not just the principle use case. It critical to understand that _any viewed realization_ is derived from the principle realization, and the principle realization remains the primary realization for hydrologic units.

In our example, the flowpath realization is the principle realization, however the need for divide geometries in the forcing (and likely rainfall runoff task) dictate a divide view of the product for our operations. The divide realization of flowpaths are uniquely identified by a `divide_id`. 

> **_NOTE:_** While all `id`s are unique. There ARE instances where a divide does not have a draining flowpath, thus those divides have a corresponding `id` property equal to `NA`. These can be removed using the `has_flowline` boolean flag property if desired, as they are NOT part of the dendritic system.

## Build a subset

To help with this example, we create a cutout of the Poudre River Basin using the hydrofabric subsetter found [here](https://github.com/LynkerIntel/hfsubset). This basin is defined as the upstream area of the NWIS location `Gages=06752260`, Colorado to extract a sample of the [CONUS NextGen Hydrofabric](https://nextgen-hydrofabric.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).
The USGS Next Generation Monitoring Location Page for this site is [here](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/06752260/)
and the Geoconnex PID can be found [here](https://reference.geoconnex.us/collections/gages/items?provider_id=06752260)

```bash
mkdir poudre
cd poudre

hfsubset -l divides,nexus,flowpaths,flowpath_attributes,hydrolocations \
         -o ./poudre-subset.gpkg \
         -r "pre-release" \
         -t hl \
         "Gages-06752260"
```

### Did we create it?

```{r}
(f = list.files("poudre", pattern = ".gpkg", full.names = TRUE))
```

### Whats in it?

```{r}
st_layers(f)
```


### Lets map it! 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../man/figures/hydrofabric.png")
```


# Forcing (Task 1)

To generate the forcing mesh (currently using EMSF) the forcing workstream needs the divide complex geometries and associated
`divide_id` of each unit. These can be pulled directly from the `divides` layer!

```{r}
read_sf(f, "divides") %>% 
  select(divide_id)
```

# Rainfall Runoff Modeling (Task 2)

The NextGen rainfall runoff modeling tasks require the ability to identify a unit of the divide complex, and its associated draining flowpath. From this, configuration files can be used to assign and/or build model formulations associated with a given `divide_id`.

While NextGen remains a primarily lumped basin model, operating at the divide scale, the _divide_ view is the ideal _viewed realization_. However, since we are not explicitly interested in geometries here, we drop them. 

> **_NOTE:_** Had we used SQLite directly to access this layer, rather than `sf`, we could have avoided reading the geometry column entirely.

```{r}
read_sf(f, "divides") %>%
  select(divide_id, id) %>%
  st_drop_geometry()
```

## Working across model formulations

Once divides are located, and models assigned, there is often a need to populate the configuration file with some pre-computed information. One example of this is operating the [NOAH OWP Modular](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/noah-owp-modular) and [CFE ](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cfe) models which require a suite of divide-summarized data. This data lives adjacent to the core hydrofabric GPKG's but can be accessed using a set of `divide_id`.

For example, lets say we want CFE and NOAH OWP data for `cat-280570`:

```{r}
open_dataset("s3://nextgen-hydrofabric/pre-release/nextgen_10L_cfe_noahowp.parquet") %>%
  filter(divide_id == "cat-280570") %>%
  collect()
```

# Routing (Task 3)

Routing is based on the flowpath to nexus connection described in the background section and requires water to move from flowpaths, into nexuses, into flowpaths.  More then one flowpath can contribute to a nexus, however only one nexus can contribute to a flowpath.

COntinuing on with our divides _view_ of the landspace, we can extract the flowpath topology.

```{r}
(network = read_sf(f, "divides") %>%
  select(divide_id, id, toid) %>%
  st_drop_geometry())
```

A hard requirement of `ngen` is that the network remains dendritic (e.g a [DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)).
We can ensure  the resultant flowpath topology, extracted from the divides view, is compliant:

```{r}
select(network, id, toid) %>%
    igraph::graph_from_data_frame(directed = TRUE) %>%
    igraph::is.dag()
```

Much like the NOAH-OWP/CFE example, knowing the connectivity of the flowpath network is half of the challenge. To successful route water through it, a range of attributes need to be supplied. Currently, these are provided within the `flowpath_attributes` layer of the hydrofabric data model:

```{r}
read_sf("poudre/poudre-subset.gpkg", "flowpath_attributes") %>%
  filter(id %in% network$id) %>%
  right_join(network)
```

The `id` can be used to extract the complete/partial _flowpath view_ if and when its needed:

```{r}
read_sf(f, "flowpaths") %>% 
  filter(id == 'wb-280570') %>%
   mapview()
```

# Reporting (Task 4)

The last task is one that is NOT well facilitated by the existing NWM and that is how do you find the locations of know Points of Interest (POIs).

For example, lets say we wanted to find the USGS gages present in the Poudre Basin. To do this we could search the hydrolocations view for instances of type `Gages`.

```{r}
(gages = read_sf(f, "hydrolocations") %>%
   filter(hl_reference == "Gages"))
```

Note that the `id` of the hydrolocations is the `toid` in the flow network topology!

In total there are `r nrow(gages)` gages in the Poudre River basin. If we want to map these, and their contributing flowpaths and divides, we simply need to walk across layers:

```{r}
(net = read_sf(f, "divides") %>%
   filter(toid %in% gages$id))
```

```{r}
(fps = read_sf(f, "flowpaths") %>%
   filter(id %in% net$id))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
mapview() + gages + net + fps
```

# Conclusion

While there are many layers presented with a hydrofabric, all views needed can be found in the divides layer. This supplies everything needed to run ngen from start to finish, and allow introspection of the results!

It is able to do this through a clear implementation of HY Features concepts, within a detailed yet flexible data model. Taking advantage of this requires an understanding that:

  (1) the principle view of the data set is the flowpath network due to the topology requirements of both ngen and t-route ,
  (2) viewing the divide "view" of the data still provides the ability to access the flowpath and nexus realizations by their identifiers,
  (3) auxiliary data can be built in relation to the appropriate realization (e.g. id, or divide_id) providing the ability for a larger data system to scaffold.
