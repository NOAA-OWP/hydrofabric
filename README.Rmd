```

### Overview

This repository serves two purpose. (1) It provides a dedicated landing page to access the Next Generation Modeling Framework (NextGen) hydrofabric artifacts and (2) a meta package of R packages that are designed for hydroscience.

NextGen artifacts are distributed by _NHDPlusV2_ **V**ector **P**rocessing **U**nits and are generated from a set of national reference datasets built in collaboration between NOAA, the USGS, and Lynker for federal water modeling efforts. These artifacts are designed to be easily updated, manipulated, and quality controlled to meet the needs of a wide range of modeling tasks while leveraging the best possible input data.


## How do I get it?

The data and documentation for the NextGen community resources can be found [here](https://noaa-owp.github.io/hydrofabric/articles/data_access.html) with detailed documentation of the geopackage contents [here](https://noaa-owp.github.io/hydrofabric/articles/hf_dm.html). NextGen artifacts are publicly available through a partnership with Lynker and the NOAA OWP. For each VPU a geopackage that contains all tables, spatial data, and lookups relevant to a hydrofabric data model 

```r
s3://nextgen-hydrofabric/{version}/nextgen_{REGION}.gpkg
s3://nextgen-hydrofabric/{version}/nextgen_{REGION}_ext.gpkg
```

## Package Installation

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("NOAA-OWP/hydrofabric")
```

## Usage

```{r}
library(hydrofabric)
```

`library(hydrofabric)` will load the core packages: 

* [nhdplusTools](https://github.com/usgs-r/nhdplusTools/) for network manipulation
* [hydrofab](https://github.com/mikejohnson51/hydrofab) a tool set for "fabricating" multiscale hydrofabrics
* [ngen.hydrofab](https://github.com/mikejohnson51/ngen.hydrofab) NextGen extensions for hydrofab
* [climateR](https://github.com/mikejohnson51/climateR) for accessing remote data resources for parameter and attributes estimation
* [zonal](https://github.com/mikejohnson51/zonal) for catchment parameter estimation

Additionally it will load key spatial data science libraries: `terra`, `sf`, `dplyr` and `glue`

    

# Background

The NextGen artifacts are a _model application_ dataset built to meet the aims of [NextGen](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/ngen). By design, these artifacts are derived from a set of general authoritative data products outlined in figure 1 that have been built in close collaboration with the USGS. 

```{r, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 1"}
knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/roadmap.png")
```

These include a set of base data that improves the network topology and geometry validity while defining a set of community hydrolocations (POIs). These 4 data products are used to build an intermediate refactored network from which one hydrofabric network has been aggregated to a set of community hydrolocations (minimal network), and one has been aggregated to a more consistent size (3-10 sqkm) with enforced POI locations (target distribution). NextGen specifically is derived from the target size aggregated product while the upcoming developments on the [National Hydrologic Model (NHM)](https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/national-hydrologic-model-infrastructure) will be built from the community minimal network. 

While these two aggregations serve a wide range of federal modeling needs, our focus on open source software development and workflows allow interested parties to build there own networks starting with either the 4 reference datasets, or the refactored network!

# Resources

- The hydrofabric builds on the OGC [HY_Features conceptual model](https://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/14-111r6/14-111r6.html), the [Hydrofabric Logical model](https://docs.ogc.org/per/22-040.html), and the proposed [Hydrofabric Data Model](https://noaa-owp.github.io/hydrofabric/articles/hf_dm.html).

- The reference, refactor, minimal, and target hydrofabrics can all be accessed [here](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/60be0e53d34e86b93891012b). A high level introduction to these resources can be found on the [USGS Water Data blog](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/blog/hydrofabric/).

# Hydrofabric Subsetter

We have created a NextGen hydrofabric subsetter. GO binaries of these can be installed at the [release page](https://github.com/LynkerIntel/hfsubset/releases).


```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
#knitr::include_graphics(c("man/figures/lynker-logo.png","man/figures/noaa-logo.png", 'man/figures/usgs-logo.png'))
# library(cowplot)
# xx = ggdraw() + 
#   draw_image("man/figures/lynker-logo.png", width = 0.33, height = .25, y = .05) + 
#   draw_image("man/figures/noaa-logo.png", width = 0.33,  height = .35, x = 0.33) + 
#   draw_image("man/figures/usgs-logo.png", width = 0.33,height = .25, x = 0.66, y = .05)
# 
# cowplot::save_plot(xx, filename = "man/figures/logos.png")
``` 

```{r, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
